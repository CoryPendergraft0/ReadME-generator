## Description
This weeks homework was to build a "readME generator" using everything we learned from node. The ReadME was created by a prompt and several 'inputs'. Get one genetrated by typing "node index.js" into your terminal to get started! Once completed, it will create a new file called "Proj-ReadME'. Open the file to view your finished product.
